# PDF Internet Awareness

This repository contains discussion drafts and technical exploration related to **internet-aware content representation in PDF documents**.

## Purpose

PDF documents are widely distributed and consumed in internet-centric contexts. They frequently contain internet-related information such as domain names, URLs, email addresses, and other network identifiers.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a neutral, technical discussion space to explore whether and how such internet-related entities could be represented in PDF content in a more explicit, machine-readable way.

## Scope

This repository focuses on:
- content representation, not viewer behavior
- structural expressiveness of PDF content
- interoperability, extraction, and automation use cases
- archival, compliance, and long-lived document scenarios

This repository explicitly does **not**:
- define a new PDF standard
- propose immediate changes to ISO 32000-2
- mandate interaction behavior (e.g. clickable links)
- replace or deprecate annotations
- introduce browser-like functionality

## Status

All documents in this repository are **non-normative discussion drafts** intended to support technical exploration and working group discussion.

See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for details.

## Relationship to PDF Association

This repository is **not** an official PDF Association or ISO publication.

Documents here may be used as discussion input for PDF Technical Working Group (TWG) conversations, application notes, or exploratory work, subject to the processes of the PDF Association.
